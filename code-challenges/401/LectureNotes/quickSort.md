# Lecture Notes: Quick Sort
> QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.

Always pick first element as pivot.
Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below)
Pick a random element as pivot.
Pick median as pivot.

## Learning Objectives
> Students will be able to create a reasonable architecture for sorting an array.

> Students will be able to implement a insertion sort. 

## Lecture Flow
> Understanding the quick sort

> Going over the pseudo code

> Implement the pseudo to actual code

> Going over the test case

> Look for alternative solutions
