# Lecture Notes: Insertion Sort
> Insertion sort is a sorting algorithm in which the elements are transferred one at a time to the right position. In other words, an insertion sort helps in building the final sorted list, one item at a time, with the movement of higher-ranked elements. 

## Learning Objectives
> Students will be able to create a reasonable architecture for sorting an array.

> Students will be able to implement a insertion sort. 

## Lecture Flow
> Understanding the merger sort

> Going over the pseudo code

> Implement the pseudo to actual code

> Going over the test case

> Look for alternative solutions
