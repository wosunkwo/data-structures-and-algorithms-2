# Lecture Notes: Insertion Sort
> In computer science, merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, which means that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that was invented by John von Neumann in 1945 

## Learning Objectives
> Students will be able to create a reasonable architecture for sorting an array.

> Students will be able to implement a insertion sort. 

## Lecture Flow
> Understanding the merger sort

> Going over the pseudo code

> Implement the pseudo to actual code

> Going over the test case

> Look for alternative solutions
