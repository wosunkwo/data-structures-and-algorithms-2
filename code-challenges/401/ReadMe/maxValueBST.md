# Max Value in Tree
Maximum Value in a Binary Tree.

# Sample Input/Output 
Please check the Visual section of solution

## Challenge
A function called find-maximum-value which takes binary tree as its only input. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.

## Approach & Efficiency
O(log N)
