# QuickSort
Implement a Quick Sort

## Challenge
QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. There are many different versions of quickSort that pick pivot in different ways.

Always pick first element as pivot.
Always pick last element as pivot (implemented below)
Pick a random element as pivot.
Pick median as pivot.

## Approach & Efficiency
The big O for Time for this approach is O(nlog(n)). Space is O(1).

## API
A method called insertionSort which need int[] array , int left, int right as a parameter

## Solution
Please refer the lecture notes section
