# Fizz Buzz Tree
Conduct “FizzBuzz” on a tree while traversing through it.

# Sample Input/Output 
[ 5 , 3, 15, 7, 91] -> [ 'Buzz' , 'Fizz', 'FizzBuzz', 7, 91]


## Challenge
A function called FizzBuzzTree which takes a tree as an argument.
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, determine weather or not the value of each node is divisible by 3, 5 or both, and change the value of each of the nodes:
If the value is divisible by 3, replace the value with “Fizz”
If the value is divisible by 5, replace the value with “Buzz”
If the value is divisible by 3 and 5, replace the value with “FizzBuzz”
Return the tree with its new values.


## Approach & Efficiency
O(log N)
