# Singly Linked List
A Linked list is a linear collection of data elements,
whose order is not given by their physical placement in memory

## Challenge
A Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.
Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to head when the linked list is instantiated.


## Approach & Efficiency
O(1) Linear

## API
- A method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

- A method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

- A method called print which takes in no arguments and returns a collection all of the current Node values in the Linked List.

- A method called getListHead to get head of the list

- A method called getNodeValue to get the value of given input. Take a Node as a parameter

- A method called getListCurrent to get the which is the current node of LL

- A method called get_LL_into_Vector which return current LL into as a vector
